# ✅ Chapter 1: Introduction to MLflow
## 🎯 What is MLflow?
MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It helps you keep track of experiments, package ML code, reproduce runs, share models, and deploy them—all in one place.

It supports any ML library (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, etc.) and is language-agnostic, although it has strong Python support.

## 🚀 Why Use MLflow in ML Projects?
### Without MLflow:
- Your experiments are scattered across notebooks or folders.
- Difficult to reproduce which model was trained with what parameters.
- Manual tracking of metrics in spreadsheets.
- Deployment involves custom scripts.

### With MLflow:
- Track parameters, metrics, models, and outputs automatically.
- Compare runs visually via a web UI.
- Package and share your code in reusable format.
- Easily deploy or serve models via API.
- Centralized Model Registry to manage multiple versions.

MLflow simplifies collaboration, reproducibility, and production-readiness in ML workflows.

## 🧩 Overview of MLflow Components
MLflow consists of four major components:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| MLflow Tracking | Record and query experiments: parameters, metrics, artifacts, and logs. |
| MLflow Projects | Package your code with environment details for reproducibility. |
| MLflow Models | Format to save/load ML models with multiple deployment options. |
| Model Registry | Central store to manage models, versioning, stage transitions, approvals. | 

We'll go deeper into each component in later chapters.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup
You can install MLflow via pip:

```python
pip install mlflow
```
To verify installation and check the version:

```bash
mlflow --version
```
MLflow also runs a local server for experiment tracking. Start it using:

```bash
mlflow ui
```
This starts a web server on http://localhost:5000 by default.

✅ First Hello World Experiment with MLflow
Let’s now do a simple machine learning experiment using scikit-learn and track everything with MLflow.

📂 Folder Structure
```bash
mlflow_hello_world/
│
├── train.py

```
## 🧪 Step-by-Step: Code Explanation
Create a file named train.py with the following code:

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Enable automatic logging (optional)
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

# Start an MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():

    # Define model and train
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

    # Manually log metrics (optional if autolog is used)
    mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)
    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 3)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", acc)

    # Log model artifact
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

    print("Logged to MLflow")


```
## ▶️ Run the Script
```python
python train.py
```
This will:

- Create an experiment
- Log the run
- Save metrics, parameters, and the trained model

## 🔎 Visualize in the UI
Start the MLflow tracking UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```
Visit: http://localhost:5000

You’ll see:

- Each run listed
- Parameters like n_estimators, max_depth
- Metrics like accuracy
- Artifacts (model, etc.)
- Source code snapshot

## 📦 Artifacts and Files
After a run, MLflow stores metadata and model files in a default directory:
```bash
mlruns/
└── 0/
    └── <run_id>/
        ├── metrics/
        ├── params/
        ├── artifacts/
        └── meta.yaml
```
# 🧠 Key Concepts Recap
- Term	Meaning
- Run	A single experiment execution
- Experiment	Group of related runs
- Artifact	Output files like models or plots
- Tracking URI	The destination (local/remote) where data is logged

---

# 📘 Chapter 2: Experiment Tracking with MLflow Tracking

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Chapter

By the end of this chapter, you will understand how to:
- Log **parameters**, **metrics**, and **artifacts** using MLflow
- Use **MLflow UI and CLI** to inspect and compare experiments
- Enable **automatic logging** with popular ML frameworks
- **Organize** experiments and runs for better traceability

---

## 🧩 1. Logging Parameters, Metrics, and Artifacts

MLflow Tracking API allows you to log:
- **Parameters**: Model or experiment configuration (e.g., learning rate, depth)
- **Metrics**: Performance indicators (e.g., accuracy, loss)
- **Artifacts**: Files generated by the run (e.g., models, plots, logs)

### ✅ Logging Manually

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn

mlflow.start_run()

mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.01)
mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.96)

# Log a model
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(trained_model, "model")

# Log an artifact (e.g., a plot)
mlflow.log_artifact("confusion_matrix.png")

mlflow.end_run()
```

You can also use `with` syntax:

```python
with mlflow.start_run():
    # do training...
    mlflow.log_param(...)
    mlflow.log_metric(...)
```

---

## 🖼️ 2. Comparing Runs Visually in MLflow UI

Start MLflow UI:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Open `http://localhost:5000`

### Inside the UI:
- Click on an **experiment name**
- Compare **runs** side-by-side
- See **parallel coordinates**, **scatter plots**, and metric trends
- Download logged files/artifacts

This is extremely useful when tuning hyperparameters across multiple runs.

---

## ⚙️ 3. Automatic Logging with Popular ML Libraries

MLflow supports **autologging** for:

| Library        | Method                  |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| scikit-learn   | `mlflow.sklearn.autolog()` |
| TensorFlow     | `mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()` |
| PyTorch Lightning | `mlflow.pytorch.autolog()` |
| XGBoost        | `mlflow.xgboost.autolog()` |
| LightGBM       | `mlflow.lightgbm.autolog()` |

### Example:

```python
import mlflow.sklearn
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

with mlflow.start_run():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

This logs:
- Parameters
- Metrics
- Model structure
- Artifacts
- Feature importance (when supported)

No manual logging required!

---

## 🧪 4. Using MLflow CLI

You can interact with experiments using MLflow’s **command-line interface**:

### List Experiments:

```bash
mlflow experiments list
```

### Create a New Experiment:

```bash
mlflow experiments create -n "My New Experiment"
```

### Run a Project (if using MLproject):

```bash
mlflow run . -P alpha=0.5
```

### Get Info About a Run:

```bash
mlflow runs list
mlflow runs describe <run_id>
```

You can also **delete** or **restore** experiments from the CLI.

---

## 🗃️ 5. Organizing Experiments and Runs

By default, MLflow logs all runs under a **default experiment** named `"Default"`.

To organize better:

### Create and Use Custom Experiments:

```python
mlflow.set_experiment("iris_classifier_dev")
```

This creates the experiment if it doesn’t exist.

### Nested Runs:

You can also track nested experiments (e.g., for cross-validation):

```python
with mlflow.start_run() as parent_run:
    for fold in range(5):
        with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):
            # Train and log each fold
            ...
```

### Set Tags:

Add metadata to your runs for filtering:

```python
mlflow.set_tag("developer", "Shubhendu")
mlflow.set_tag("stage", "dev")
```

In the UI, you can **filter** runs based on tags like `stage = 'prod'`.

---

---

## 🧪 Optional Exercise

Try modifying your `train.py` from Chapter 1:
- Enable `autolog()`
- Run the script multiple times with different `max_depth` values
- Use `set_experiment("iris_rf_experiment")`
- View and compare runs in the UI

---



# 📘 Chapter 3: Packaging ML Code with MLflow Projects

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Chapter

This chapter teaches you how to **package your ML code** using **MLflow Projects** for **reproducibility**, **portability**, and **scalability**. By the end, you’ll be able to:
- Define the structure of an MLflow Project
- Use the `MLproject` file and conda environments
- Run MLflow Projects locally and remotely
- Use Git integration for versioned and portable runs

---

## 📦 1. Structure of an MLflow Project

An **MLflow Project** is a **directory** with your ML code and a special file called `MLproject` that defines how to run your code.

### ✅ Basic Structure

```
my_ml_project/
├── MLproject
├── conda.yaml         # or requirements.txt
├── train.py           # entry point script
└── data/
```

Each MLflow Project must contain:
- An **MLproject file** that defines the project entry point
- A way to specify dependencies: either `conda.yaml` or `requirements.txt`
- The actual code (e.g., `train.py`)

---

## 📝 2. MLproject File and Conda Environments

### Example `MLproject` File:

```yaml
name: iris_rf_project

conda_env: conda.yaml

entry_points:
  main:
    parameters:
      n_estimators: {type: int, default: 100}
      max_depth: {type: int, default: 3}
    command: >
      python train.py --n_estimators {n_estimators} --max_depth {max_depth}
```

This file does the following:
- **Gives the project a name**
- Points to a Conda environment definition (`conda.yaml`)
- Defines **entry points** (like functions or scripts) and their parameters

### Example `conda.yaml`:

```yaml
name: iris_env
channels:
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.10
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - pip
  - pip:
      - mlflow
```

MLflow will **create an isolated environment** using this file before running the project.

---

## ▶️ 3. Running Projects Locally and Remotely

### ✅ Run Locally

Navigate to the directory and run:

```bash
mlflow run . -P n_estimators=150 -P max_depth=5
```

This:
- Creates a new Conda environment (if not cached)
- Runs `train.py` with the given parameters
- Tracks the run and logs results

You can also run from a Git repo:

```bash
mlflow run https://github.com/yourusername/your-ml-project.git -P max_depth=5
```

MLflow clones the repo, sets up the env, and runs the project.

---

### 📡 Run Remotely

You can run the project remotely using a **remote MLflow Tracking Server** and **backend** like Databricks or a remote Docker server. (We'll cover this in Chapter 5.)

For now, the key takeaway is:
> MLflow Projects make your code portable and reproducible across machines or teams.

---

## 🔁 4. Using Git to Manage MLflow Projects

MLflow is designed to work **seamlessly with Git repositories**.

### Why Use Git?
- Version control of code and experiments
- Reproducible runs: MLflow logs Git commit hash of each run
- Easy sharing with others

### Example:

You can run an MLflow Project from a GitHub repo like this:

```bash
mlflow run https://github.com/username/mlflow-iris-example.git -P n_estimators=200
```

It will:
- Clone the repo
- Use the `MLproject` and `conda.yaml` from that repo
- Track and run the experiment

This makes collaboration much easier in teams.

---

## 📘 Bonus: Multiple Entry Points

You can define more than one script as an entry point:

```yaml
entry_points:
  train:
    parameters:
      epochs: {type: int, default: 10}
    command: python train.py --epochs {epochs}

  evaluate:
    parameters:
      model_path: {type: str}
    command: python evaluate.py --model {model_path}
```

Run a specific entry point:

```bash
mlflow run . -e evaluate -P model_path=models/model.pkl
```

---

| Git integration         | Enables reproducibility and collaboration                       |

---

## 🧪 Optional Exercise

Create a new MLflow Project:

1. Make a folder: `my_first_project/`
2. Add `train.py` that accepts parameters using `argparse`
3. Add `MLproject` and `conda.yaml`
4. Run the project with different parameters
5. Use `mlflow ui` to track the runs

---

# 📘 Chapter 4: Managing Models with MLflow Models & Model Registry

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Chapter

This chapter will teach you how to:
- Save and load models using MLflow
- Understand MLflow model **flavors** and framework support
- Use the **Model Registry** for versioning and stage transitions
- Serve models via a **REST API**

---

## 💾 1. Saving and Loading Models with MLflow

### ✅ Saving a model

MLflow provides built-in support to log and save models. You can log a model during an experiment like this:

```python
import mlflow.sklearn

# Save the model under the "model" artifact path
mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

This stores the model in the MLflow **artifacts directory**, and registers its metadata.

You can also **manually save** a model:

```python
mlflow.sklearn.save_model(model, path="saved_model")
```

### ✅ Loading a model

To load a model back later:

```python
loaded_model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model("runs:/<run_id>/model")
preds = loaded_model.predict(X_test)
```

You can also load a local saved model:

```python
model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model("saved_model")
```

---

## 🧪 2. Model Flavors and Supported Frameworks

MLflow supports **multiple ML frameworks**, each with its own **flavor**.

| Framework        | Flavor module                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Scikit-learn     | `mlflow.sklearn`               |
| TensorFlow       | `mlflow.tensorflow`            |
| PyTorch          | `mlflow.pytorch`               |
| XGBoost          | `mlflow.xgboost`               |
| LightGBM         | `mlflow.lightgbm`              |
| H2O              | `mlflow.h2o`                   |
| Generic Python   | `mlflow.pyfunc`                |

### What is a Flavor?

A **flavor** is a way MLflow represents a model. A single model can have **multiple flavors**, including:

- `python_function`: A generic interface for model inference
- Framework-specific (e.g., `sklearn`, `tensorflow`, etc.)

This makes models portable and framework-agnostic.

---

## 🏛️ 3. Registering, Versioning, and Stage Transitioning Models

MLflow provides a **Model Registry** to manage models like a software package:
- **Register** models from experiment runs
- **Version** control and track model lineage
- Assign models to **stages** like `Staging`, `Production`, `Archived`
- Allow **comments and annotations** for collaboration

### ✅ Register a model

After logging a model during a run:

```python
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()
run_id = "<your_run_id>"

# Register the model
result = client.create_registered_model("iris_rf_model")
model_uri = f"runs:/{run_id}/model"

client.create_model_version(name="iris_rf_model", source=model_uri, run_id=run_id)
```

Alternatively, use autologging and register from the UI.

---

### ✅ Transition a model version to a stage

```python
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="iris_rf_model",
    version=1,
    stage="Production"
)
```

Stages include:
- `None`
- `Staging`
- `Production`
- `Archived`

This lets you safely **promote models** across development pipelines.

---

### ✅ Load from registry

```python
model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model("models:/iris_rf_model/Production")
```

---

## 🌐 4. Serving Models via REST API

MLflow can serve any registered model as a **REST API server** using:

```bash
mlflow models serve -m models:/iris_rf_model/Production -p 1234
```

### 📨 Send a request

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:1234/invocations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "columns": ["sepal length (cm)", "sepal width (cm)", "petal length (cm)", "petal width (cm)"],
        "data": [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]
      }'
```

### 🛠 Notes:
- The API expects a `pandas`-style JSON format
- Responses are predictions like `[0]`

You can also deploy models with:
- **Docker containers**: `mlflow models build-docker`
- **Cloud platforms**: Azure ML, AWS Sagemaker (via plugins)

---

---

## 🧪 Optional Exercise

1. Train a new model using scikit-learn.
2. Log the model with `mlflow.sklearn.log_model()`.
3. Register the model in MLflow Registry.
4. Promote it to "Staging", then "Production".
5. Serve it with `mlflow models serve`.
6. Test it via `curl` or Postman.

---

# 📘 Chapter 5: Deploying and Scaling with MLflow

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Chapter

In this final chapter, you'll learn how to **deploy and scale MLflow in real-world production scenarios**. By the end, you’ll understand:
- Various model deployment options (Local, REST, Docker, Cloud)
- How to integrate MLflow with platforms like **SageMaker**, **Azure ML**, and **Kubernetes**
- How to set up a **remote MLflow Tracking Server**
- Best practices for deploying and scaling ML systems with MLflow

---

## 🚀 1. Model Deployment Options

MLflow offers several ways to **deploy your trained models**, depending on your infrastructure and needs.

### ✅ A. Local REST API

Serve a model from the local machine:

```bash
mlflow models serve -m models:/iris_rf_model/Production -p 1234
```

- Serves the model as a REST API on `http://localhost:1234/invocations`
- Accepts JSON requests (in Pandas DataFrame format)
- Fast and easy for testing

---

### ✅ B. Docker Container

You can package your model as a **Docker image**:

```bash
mlflow models build-docker -m models:/iris_rf_model/Production -n iris_image
```

Then run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 1234:8080 iris_image
```

- Good for containerized environments
- Works well with Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, etc.

---

### ✅ C. Cloud Platforms

MLflow supports **direct deployment** to:

#### 🔹 Amazon SageMaker

```bash
mlflow sagemaker deploy --app-name iris-app \
  -m models:/iris_rf_model/Production \
  --region us-west-2
```

You must configure:
- AWS credentials
- IAM roles
- S3 bucket for storing models

#### 🔹 Azure ML

With the [MLflow-Azure plugin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-use-mlflow):

```bash
mlflow azureml build-and-push-container-image -m models:/iris_rf_model/Production
```

Then deploy it to Azure ML endpoints.

---

### ✅ D. Kubernetes (Advanced)

Using `mlflow models serve` inside a Docker container, you can run the model in Kubernetes.

Steps:
1. Build Docker image with MLflow model
2. Push to container registry (DockerHub, ECR, ACR)
3. Write Kubernetes deployment + service YAML files
4. Deploy using `kubectl apply -f <file.yaml>`

This is suitable for **high-availability**, **scalable**, and **load-balanced** deployments.

---

## 🌐 2. Integrating MLflow with External Tools

MLflow integrates with popular MLOps and orchestration platforms:

| Tool         | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **SageMaker** | Deploy model endpoints in AWS |
| **Azure ML**  | Deploy and manage models on Azure cloud |
| **Kubernetes** | Scalable, self-managed model serving |
| **Airflow**   | Schedule ML training/deployment workflows |
| **Databricks** | Native MLflow support with collaborative tracking |

You can also use MLflow models inside CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

---

## 🛠️ 3. Setting Up a Remote MLflow Tracking Server

MLflow supports **remote tracking** to a central server for collaboration.

### ✅ Step-by-step

#### Step 1: Start Tracking Server

```bash
mlflow server \
  --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db \
  --default-artifact-root ./mlruns \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

For production:
- Use **PostgreSQL/MySQL** instead of SQLite
- Use **S3/GCS/Azure Blob** for artifact storage
- Secure with **nginx + HTTPS + authentication**

#### Step 2: Point Your Client

Set the tracking URI in your scripts:

```python
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://<your-server-ip>:5000")
```

Or set the environment variable:

```bash
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://<your-server-ip>:5000
```

Now all runs will be logged to the **remote server**, not the local file system.

---

## ✅ 4. Best Practices for Production ML with MLflow

### ✅ Version Everything
- Track all model versions and parameters
- Use Git for versioning code and data pipeline scripts

### ✅ Use Model Registry
- Register your models and clearly define stages (`Staging`, `Production`)
- Automate stage transitions using CI/CD

### ✅ Automate with Pipelines
- Use orchestration tools (Airflow, Prefect, Kubeflow) to automate training, evaluation, and deployment

### ✅ Separate Dev and Prod
- Use **different environments** or **namespaces** for dev vs prod
- Avoid serving experimental models directly to users

### ✅ Monitor and Retrain
- Monitor model performance in production
- Trigger retraining workflows if drift is detected

### ✅ Secure Everything
- Use SSL, auth proxies (e.g., nginx with basic auth or OAuth)
- Protect artifact storage (S3, GCS) with IAM policies
