## 🧠 1. Introduction to Deep Learning

### 🔍 What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, known as **artificial neural networks**. It’s powerful for tasks involving unstructured data like images, audio, text, and video.

### 💡 Real-World Applications:
- Self-driving cars (Computer Vision)
- Language translation (NLP)
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Fraud detection (Tabular data)
- Medical image diagnostics

### 🧱 Building Blocks:
- **Neurons** and **Layers**
- **Forward pass** (prediction)
- **Loss** (error)
- **Backpropagation** (learning)
- **Optimization** (weight tuning)

---

## 🔥 2. Why PyTorch? History, Ecosystem & Use Cases

### 🔧 Why PyTorch?
- Dynamic computation graph (flexible and pythonic)
- Easy debugging and prototyping
- Widely adopted in research and production

### ⏳ Brief History:
- Released by Facebook’s AI Research (FAIR) in 2016
- Popularity skyrocketed after 2018 due to its ease of use

### 🌐 Ecosystem:
- **Torchvision** – Computer Vision datasets/models
- **Torchtext** – NLP datasets and preprocessing
- **Torchaudio** – Audio datasets and transformations
- **TorchServe** – Model serving framework
- **PyTorch Lightning** – High-level framework to reduce boilerplate

---

## 💻 3. Installing PyTorch and Setting Up the Environment

### ✅ Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+
- pip, conda (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

### 🔌 Installation:

#### Using pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

#### Check GPU support:
```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```

#### Recommended: Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv dl-env
source dl-env/bin/activate  # or dl-env\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

---

## 📦 4. Tensors: The Backbone of PyTorch

### 🧱 What is a Tensor?
Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays (like NumPy arrays) but optimized for GPU operations.

```python
import torch

# Create tensors
a = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
b = torch.ones((2, 3))
c = torch.randn((3, 3))  # Normal distribution

print(a.shape, b.dtype, c.device)
```

### ⚙️ Key Operations:
```python
# Reshaping
a = torch.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)

# Mathematical operations
sum_tensor = a + 5
product = torch.matmul(a, a.T)

# Move to GPU (if available)
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    a = a.to("cuda")
```

### ⚠️ Common Mistake:
Mixing CPU and GPU tensors in operations causes errors. Always `.to('cuda')` or `.to('cpu')` consistently.

---

## 🔁 5. Autograd and Computation Graphs

### 🔍 What is Autograd?
PyTorch automatically tracks operations on tensors to compute gradients for backpropagation.

```python
x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True)
y = x ** 2 + 3 * x
y.backward()
print(x.grad)  # dy/dx = 2x + 3 = 7
```

### 🌳 Computation Graph:
Each operation on a tensor builds a graph behind the scenes. When `.backward()` is called, gradients are computed using this graph.

### ⚠️ Common Pitfall:
Calling `.backward()` multiple times without `retain_graph=True` will throw an error.

---

## 🧰 6. PyTorch Basics: Dataset, DataLoader, and Transforms

### 📁 Dataset & DataLoader
Used to load and preprocess data efficiently in batches.

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

features = torch.rand((100, 10))
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,))
dataset = TensorDataset(features, labels)
loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=8, shuffle=True)

for x_batch, y_batch in loader:
    print(x_batch.shape, y_batch.shape)
```

### 🌀 Transforms (especially for images)
```python
from torchvision import transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((128, 128)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.5], std=[0.5])
])
```

---

## 🧪 Exercises

1. ✅ Install PyTorch and check if CUDA is available.
2. 💡 Create a 2D tensor and perform addition, multiplication, reshaping.
3. 🧠 Build a basic custom dataset and DataLoader.
4. 🔍 Use autograd to compute gradients for a simple quadratic function.

## 🧠 1. Neurons, Weights, Bias, Activation Functions

### 🔍 Neuron:
A neuron takes weighted inputs, adds a bias, and passes it through an activation function.

**Mathematical formula:**
```
y = Activation(Wx + b)
```

### 🧱 Components:
- **Weights (`W`)**: Determine the strength of connections.
- **Bias (`b`)**: Allows shifting the activation.
- **Activation function (`f`)**: Adds non-linearity.

### 🚀 Common Activation Functions:
| Function      | Formula                  | Use Case                          |
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Sigmoid       | 1 / (1 + exp(-x))         | Binary classification             |
| Tanh          | (exp(x)-exp(-x))/(exp(x)+exp(-x)) | Centered data        |
| ReLU          | max(0, x)                 | Most common, avoids vanishing grads |
| Leaky ReLU    | max(αx, x)                | Solves dying ReLU problem         |
| Softmax       | exp(xi)/∑exp(xj)          | Multiclass classification output  |

---

## 🔁 2. Forward and Backward Propagation

### 🔼 Forward Propagation:
- Multiply inputs by weights
- Add bias
- Apply activation
- Repeat layer by layer

### 🔽 Backward Propagation:
- Compute loss
- Use chain rule (autograd) to calculate gradients
- Update weights via optimization step

```python
import torch
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
w = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor(1.0, requires_grad=True)

y = torch.dot(w, x) + b
y.backward()

print(w.grad, b.grad)  # ∂y/∂w, ∂y/∂b
```

---

## 🏗️ 3. Building a Neural Network with `nn.Module`

### 💡 Why `nn.Module`?
PyTorch allows modular and readable architecture design using `nn.Module`.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 50)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc2(x)

model = SimpleNN()
print(model)
```

### 🔧 Key Layers:
- `nn.Linear`: Fully connected layer
- `nn.Conv2d`: Convolutional layer
- `nn.ReLU`, `nn.Sigmoid`, etc.: Activations
- `nn.Sequential`: Stack layers easily

---

## 📉 4. Loss Functions and Optimizers

### 🧮 Loss Functions:
```python
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()         # Regression
loss_fn = nn.BCELoss()         # Binary Classification
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() # Multiclass Classification
```

### 🛠️ Optimizers:
```python
import torch.optim as optim

optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
# Also: Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad, etc.
```

---

## 🔄 5. Training, Validation, and Testing Loops

```python
for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()
    for x_batch, y_batch in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()      # Reset gradients
        predictions = model(x_batch)
        loss = loss_fn(predictions, y_batch)
        loss.backward()           # Backprop
        optimizer.step()          # Update weights

    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        val_loss = 0
        for x_val, y_val in val_loader:
            val_preds = model(x_val)
            val_loss += loss_fn(val_preds, y_val).item()
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Validation Loss: {val_loss:.4f}")
```

### ✅ Best Practices:
- Shuffle training data
- Use `.train()` and `.eval()` appropriately
- Apply early stopping based on validation loss

---

## 💾 6. Saving, Loading, and Fine-tuning Models

### 💾 Save Model Weights:
```python
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pth")
```

### 📥 Load Weights:
```python
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))
model.eval()
```

### 🛠️ Fine-tuning:
Freeze earlier layers:
```python
for param in model.fc1.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
```

Replace output layer:
```python
model.fc2 = nn.Linear(50, new_output_dim)
```

---

## 🧪 Exercises

1. Build a 2-layer neural net using `nn.Module` for binary classification.
2. Manually implement forward and backward passes using tensors.
3. Use `CrossEntropyLoss` and train a model on dummy data.
4. Save your model and reload it to evaluate on test samples.
5. Modify the output layer of an existing model for a new task.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- Use `.zero_grad()` **before** `loss.backward()` in every iteration.
- Wrap test/val code in `torch.no_grad()` to save memory.
- Use `.detach()` when you don’t want to track gradients for a tensor.
- Use `scheduler.step()` **after** optimizer step if using learning rate schedulers.

## 🧠 1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### 🔍 Why CNNs?
CNNs are specialized for grid-like data such as images. They extract spatial features using filters.

### 🧱 Key Components:
- **Convolution Layer (`nn.Conv2d`)**
- **Activation (ReLU)**
- **Pooling (`nn.MaxPool2d`)**
- **Flattening + Fully Connected Layers**

### 🧰 Example:
```python
import torch.nn as nn

class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2),
            nn.Conv2d(16, 32, 3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.MaxPool2d(2)
        )
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(32 * 7 * 7, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 10)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        return self.fc(x)
```

### 🧪 Common Mistakes:
- Forgetting to reshape tensors before feeding to `nn.Linear`
- Misaligned channel dimensions (check input shape!)

---

## 🌍 2. Transfer Learning using Pretrained Models

### 🔄 What is Transfer Learning?
Reuse a pretrained model (like ResNet) trained on large datasets (ImageNet) and fine-tune it for your task.

### 🛠️ Example:
```python
from torchvision import models

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False  # Freeze all layers

model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, 2)  # Replace output layer
```

### 📌 When to Fine-tune:
- **Few data:** Freeze most layers
- **More data:** Unfreeze and train some deeper layers

---

## 🔁 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTMs

### ⏳ Why RNNs?
Used for sequence data: NLP, time series, speech.

### 🔁 RNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):
- **RNN**: Basic, but suffers from vanishing gradients
- **LSTM**: Handles long-term dependencies via gating mechanism

### 🧰 LSTM Example:
```python
class LSTMClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        _, (h_n, _) = self.lstm(x)
        return self.fc(h_n[-1])
```

### 📏 Input shape:
`[batch_size, seq_length, input_dim]`

---

## 🛡️ 4. Regularization Techniques

### 🔥 Dropout:
Randomly sets activations to 0 during training to prevent overfitting.

```python
nn.Dropout(p=0.5)
```

### ⚙️ Batch Normalization:
Normalizes layer inputs to stabilize and accelerate training.

```python
nn.BatchNorm1d(num_features)
nn.BatchNorm2d(num_features)
```

### Best Practice:
Use Dropout **after activation**; BatchNorm **before activation** (typically).

---

## 🎯 5. Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation

### 🎛️ What to Tune:
- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Dropout rate
- Number of layers/neurons
- Weight decay

### 🔍 Grid Search Example:
```python
# Use libraries like optuna, Ray Tune, or manually vary params
for lr in [0.1, 0.01, 0.001]:
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=lr)
    # train loop here
```

### 📊 Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1
- Confusion Matrix

---

## 🧰 6. Debugging and Visualizing Models with TensorBoard

### 📈 Why Use TensorBoard?
Track training loss, accuracy, histograms, and more.

### 🔧 Setup:
```bash
pip install tensorboard
```

### 🧪 Logging Example:
```python
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

writer = SummaryWriter()
writer.add_scalar("Loss/train", loss.item(), epoch)
writer.add_graph(model, inputs=torch.randn(1, 1, 28, 28))
writer.close()
```

### 👁️ Launch:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

---

## 🧪 Exercises

1. Build a CNN for MNIST or CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Load a pretrained ResNet and fine-tune the last layer.
3. Train an LSTM on sequential data (e.g., sine wave, text).
4. Add dropout and batch norm and compare performance.
5. Log your training using TensorBoard.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- Always freeze layers **before** replacing the classifier.
- Use `.view(x.size(0), -1)` carefully to flatten in CNNs.
- BatchNorm improves performance even without dropout.
- Early stopping is a great regularization trick during tuning.
- Use learning rate schedulers like `StepLR`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`.

## 🔦 1. Attention Mechanisms & Transformers (Intro Level)

### 🧠 Why Attention?
Attention helps models focus on relevant parts of input sequences. Unlike RNNs, it enables parallel computation and long-range context.

### 🧰 Scaled Dot-Product Attention:
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) * V
```

- Q: Queries
- K: Keys
- V: Values

### ⚙️ Transformer Building Blocks:
- Multi-head self-attention
- Positional encoding
- LayerNorm + Residual Connections
- Feedforward layers

### 🛠️ PyTorch Example:
```python
import torch.nn as nn

attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=64, num_heads=4)
x = torch.rand(10, 32, 64)  # (seq_len, batch, embed_dim)
out, _ = attention(x, x, x)
```

### 🔗 Resource:
[The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)

---

## 📦 2. Building Custom Datasets and Dataloaders

### 🔧 Why Custom Dataset?
Useful when your data isn't in a standard format or structure.

### 🧰 Custom Dataset Class:
```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, file_paths, labels, transform=None):
        self.paths = file_paths
        self.labels = labels
        self.transform = transform

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        image = read_image(self.paths[idx])  # your own loader
        label = self.labels[idx]
        if self.transform:
            image = self.transform(image)
        return image, label

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.paths)
```

### ⚠️ Tip:
Always test `__getitem__` output shape and type before using in training.

---

## 🧠 3. Multi-GPU Training and Distributed Learning

### 🚀 Basic Multi-GPU Training:
```python
model = nn.DataParallel(model)
model = model.cuda()
```

### 🧠 Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) – Production-ready:
```python
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP
```

### ⚙️ Considerations:
- Set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
- Use `torch.distributed.launch` or `torchrun`
- Sync gradients across devices

### 📌 Learn More:
[Distributed Training Docs](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html)

---

## ⚙️ 4. Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 📉 Learning Rate Schedulers:
```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR

scheduler = StepLR(optimizer, step_size=10, gamma=0.1)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    train(...)
    scheduler.step()
```

Other options:
- `ReduceLROnPlateau`
- `CosineAnnealingLR`
- `OneCycleLR`

---

### ⚡ Mixed Precision Training (AMP):
Saves memory & speeds up training (especially on GPUs with Tensor Cores).

```python
from torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler, autocast

scaler = GradScaler()

for inputs, targets in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    with autocast():
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, targets)
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
```

---

## 🪶 5. Model Quantization, Pruning, and ONNX Export

### 🧮 Quantization (reduce model size/latency):
```python
model.qconfig = torch.quantization.get_default_qconfig("fbgemm")
torch.quantization.prepare(model, inplace=True)
# Calibrate with few batches...
torch.quantization.convert(model, inplace=True)
```

### ✂️ Pruning:
Remove redundant neurons/connections.
```python
import torch.nn.utils.prune as prune

prune.l1_unstructured(model.fc, name='weight', amount=0.3)
```

### 📤 Export to ONNX:
```python
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx")
```

ONNX = Open Neural Network Exchange (cross-framework deployment)

---

## 📚 6. Case Studies

### 🎨 A. Style Transfer
Blend content of one image with the style of another using CNN feature maps and optimization.

- Loss = Content Loss + Style Loss
- Uses VGG-based feature extraction

🔗 [Official Style Transfer Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html)

---

### 🧙 B. GANs – Generative Adversarial Networks

Two networks:
- **Generator**: Creates fake samples
- **Discriminator**: Detects real vs fake

```python
loss = real_loss + fake_loss
loss.backward()
```

Common use: image generation, face synthesis, data augmentation

🔗 [PyTorch GAN Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html)

---

### 🔍 C. Object Detection

- **Faster R-CNN**, **YOLO**, **SSD**
- PyTorch provides pretrained models via `torchvision.models.detection`

```python
from torchvision.models.detection import fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn

model = fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn(pretrained=True)
model.eval()
```

Use in real-time apps, autonomous driving, robotics, etc.

---

## 🧪 Exercises

1. Implement basic attention using `nn.MultiheadAttention`.
2. Create a custom dataset class for your own image/text data.
3. Train a model using `DataParallel` or try DDP.
4. Use `ReduceLROnPlateau` or `OneCycleLR` for better convergence.
5. Quantize a small CNN and export it to ONNX.
6. Run a style transfer or DCGAN model on sample data.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

- Mixed precision often gives ~2x speedup on A100/RTX GPUs.
- DDP > DataParallel for performance; don’t use both together.
- Always validate quantized/pruned models for performance drops.
- Use TensorRT or ONNX Runtime for optimized inference.
- Custom datasets should raise exceptions early if malformed.

## ✅ Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

1. **Skipping the Fundamentals**  
   - **Mistake**: Jumping into complex models without understanding tensors, autograd, or training loops.  
   - **Fix**: Master Chapter 1 before moving ahead. Practice with tensor operations and basic networks.

2. **Improper Data Handling**  
   - **Mistake**: Not normalizing data, incorrect use of train/test splits, using data leaks.  
   - **Fix**: Use `torchvision.transforms`, `train_test_split`, and understand `DataLoader`.

3. **Overfitting the Model**  
   - **Mistake**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.  
   - **Fix**: Use dropout, regularization, data augmentation, early stopping.

4. **Using Wrong Loss Functions or Optimizers**  
   - **Mistake**: Using MSELoss for classification or CrossEntropy for regression.  
   - **Fix**: Match loss function with task type.

5. **Ignoring Device Management (CPU/GPU)**  
   - **Mistake**: Training on GPU but doing inference on CPU without `.to(device)`.  
   - **Fix**: Manage `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")` properly.

6. **Not Using Validation Set Properly**  
   - **Mistake**: Using test set for hyperparameter tuning.  
   - **Fix**: Split data into train, validation, and test.

7. **Lack of Reproducibility**  
   - **Mistake**: Results change on every run.  
   - **Fix**: Set random seeds:  
     ```python
     import torch, random, numpy as np  
     torch.manual_seed(42); random.seed(42); np.random.seed(42)
     ```
